					<description><![CDATA[I was very interested to read your comment &quot;academic success is dependent on hard work, or task commitment ...&quot; Unfortunately in the UK we&#039;ve found that this isn&#039;t always the case. 

You may or may have heard about the changes to GCSE grade boundaries. There has been very serious disquiet to Michael Gove (Education Minister) over the exam boards’ decision to move the goal posts for this summer’s assessments in order to improve its rigour.

The impact of this is that it&#039;s has meant students who submitted work for grading in June would have had to get more marks to secure a C than those graded in January. Ever since results were published last month and frustrated schools identified the problem, schools have been working to assess the impact of that change on the county’s young people, which means that at least 140 schools have missed the Government&#039;s minimum exam target. They are now facing the possibility of closure or conversion to academies.

I&#039;m a private tutor of some 15 years standing and whilst not personally affected by this, I do take it very personally. 

If you have any thoughts on this I&#039;d be delighted to hear from you.
