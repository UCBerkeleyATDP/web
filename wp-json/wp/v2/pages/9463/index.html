As expectations are high and courses are fast-paced, even one absence makes it difficult to keep pace. Therefore, students are expected to attend every class session. Missing too much class time for any reason may result in dismissal from the program without refund. Even in the case of unanticipated circumstances, there are some things that cannot be \u201cmade up\u201d (such as introductions, class participation, group activities, presentations, or examinations, for example).\n<\/p>\n<p>In the Secondary Division, attendance decisions are not related to whether the student is seeking an A-G requirement or high school credit. Students who miss class time may not receive a final grade or evaluation. Attending every class does not guarantee that a student will receive a passing grade.<\/p>\n<h4>Anticipated attendance conflicts<\/h4>\n<p>All matters affecting regular attendance\u2014absence, coming late, or leaving early\u2014must be communicated in writing to the program office (not the instructor) by the parent\/guardian (not the student). If there are special circumstances that will affect a student\u2019s ability to attend every class, please contact the program office in writing before applying. Barring exceptional circumstances, students who anticipate missing too much class time will not be allowed to attend the program. Anticipated absences not addressed prior to the full refund deadline (see each <a href=\"\/programs\/\">program&#8217;s<\/a> calendar) will not be accommodated. A student\u2019s attendance record will be taken into account in admission decisions in subsequent years.<\/p>\n<h4>Unanticipated attendance issues<\/h4>\n<p>If there is an unexpected absence (e.g., illness, emergencies)\u2014including leaving before the end of the class meeting\u2014the parent or guardian must contact the ATDP main office. Please note that unlike the regular school year, there are no excused absences at ATDP.\n<\/p>\n<h4>Tardies<\/h4>\n<p>Students must be on time to class meetings, and are expected to be ready to begin class exactly on time. Students who are tardy twice accrue an absence. Students who are tardy a third time may be dismissed from the program without refund.\n<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"conduct\" id=\"conduct\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 data-magellan-destination=\"conduct\">&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>Code of Conduct <a href=\"#conduct\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h2>\n<hr>\n<h4>Academic Integrity<\/h4>\n<p>ATDP requires a high level of responsibility and academic honesty from its students. Scholastic dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, collusion, the submission for credit of any work or materials that are attributable in whole or in part to another person, taking an examination for another person, any act designed to give unfair advantage to a student or the attempt to commit such acts. Any student who commits an act of scholastic dishonesty is subject to dismissal from ATDP without refund.\n<\/p>\n<h4>Behavior<\/h4>\n<p>Inappropriate\/unacceptable conduct includes but is not limited to behavior that disrupts instruction, disrespects any member of the ATDP community, misuses technology used for instruction, or exhibits uncivil behavior. This also includes transmitting any inappropriate or objectionable behavior, imagery, speech, or other content during online meetings, whether intentional or unintentional. Any student who commits an act of inappropriate conduct, or whose family member commits such acts while interacting with ATDP staff, faculty or students, is subject to dismissal from ATDP without refund.\n<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"conditions\" id=\"enrollment\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 data-magellan-destination=\"conditions\">&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>Conditions of Enrollment <a href=\"#enrollment\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h2>\n<hr>\n<h4>Disclosure<\/h4>\n<p>Parents or guardians of attending students must inform ATDP of any special circumstances or potential conflicts that may affect the student&#8217;s ability to attend live online class meetings, complete coursework, or abide by behavioral standards required by the Program. (These should be listed in the &#8216;Concerns&#8217; section of students\u2019 Enrollment Form.) In the event of a conflict with these policies, ATDP reserves the right to dismiss students from the program without refund and to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis.\n<\/p>\n<h4>Possession of instructional materials<\/h4>\n<p>Materials (e.g., slides, charts, pictures, audio recordings) presented by an instructor(s) during instruction are the property of ATDP and\/or the ATDP instructor(s). ATDP instructors may use their discretion regarding what materials to share. They are under no obligation to share entire slide decks, for instance, because a student was unable to attend a particular class.\n<\/p>\n<h4>Releases<\/h4>\n<p>Because participation at ATDP is voluntary, the University requires parents\/guardians of participating minors to sign the following releases and waivers:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Photo and Video Release<\/strong><br \/>\nI authorize the UC Berkeley Academic Talent Development Program and its officers, agents, or employees (hereafter referred to as \u201cATDP\u201d) to photograph, record, film, or videotape my child; this includes photographing, recording, filming, or videotaping my child during any and all remote instruction activities. I understand that any photograph, sound recording, motion picture, or video taken of my child under this assignment is for the purpose of collecting and\/or representing factual information in the interest of serving the University of California&#8217;s mission of research, education, and public service, and for promoting the public good. I release the University, its officers, agents, and employees from any and all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with the use of said photographs, sound recordings, motion pictures, or videos, including but not limited to any and all claims for invasion of privacy, defamation, or infringement of copyright.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Waiver of Liability<\/strong><br \/>\nI, for myself, my heirs, personal representatives or assigns, do hereby release, waive, discharge, and covenant not to sue The Regents of the University officers, employees, and agents from liability from any and all claims including the negligence of The Regents of the University of California, its officers, employees and agents, personal injury, accidents or illnesses (including death), and property loss arising from, but not limited to, participation in ATDP classes and activities.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These legal agreements are included as part of students\u2019 Enrollment Form.\n<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"contact\" id=\"contact\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 data-magellan-destination=\"contact\">&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>Family Contact <a href=\"#contact\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h2>\n<hr>\n<p>For direct communication, ATDP attempts to contact families first by email, then by phone, then by post mail if necessary. ATDP collects student email addresses for the sole purposes of (1) notifying parents and students of their application status, (2) sending program news and announcements, (3) providing them to instructors to facilitate communications regarding coursework during the summer program, (4) requesting feedback about the student\u2019s experiences involving the program, and (5) informing students of research participation opportunities. Students are not required to provide an email address; ATDP will instead use the parent\u2019s email address for messages intended for the student.\n<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"nondiscrimination\" id=\"nondiscrimination\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 data-magellan-destination=\"nondiscrimination\">&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>Nondiscrimination <a href=\"#nondiscrimination\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h2>\n<hr>\n<p>The University of California, in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap, or age in any of its policies, procedures, or practices; nor does the University discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. This nondiscrimination policy covers admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, University programs and activities, including but not limited to, academic admissions, financial aid, educational services, and student employment.\n<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"refunds\" id=\"refunds\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 data-magellan-destination=\"refunds\">&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>Refunds <a href=\"#refunds\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h2>\n<hr>\n<p>A parent whose registered student is unable to attend must withdraw the student in writing and may request a tuition refund. Prior to each program\u2019s full refund deadline, tuition and program fee payments are refundable. After this date, refunds are subject to the ATDP Refund Schedule, which will be published along with course placement offers. No refund will be made in the case of a student who fails to attend classes or is withdrawn from ATDP for failure to meet the standards of appropriate behavior, including completion of homework. The $50 application processing fee is also nonrefundable.\n<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"research\" id=\"research\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 data-magellan-destination=\"research\">&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>Research Participation <a href=\"#research\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h2>\n<hr>\n<p>ATDP has a responsibility to conduct research that contributes new knowledge that leads to growth and improvement in our understanding of how academically talented students learn and how they can be better served. We ask our students and their families to assist in this effort by contributing between 1 and 3 hours per year to participating in this research. However, opting not to participate in research will in no way affect admission into the program. Before a student can participate in a study, ATDP gives detailed information about it to the student and his or her parent(s) and obtains their informed consent in writing.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Program Policies &nbsp; Attendance Code of Conduct Conditions of Enrollment Family Contact Nondiscrimination Refunds Research &nbsp; Attendance There are no excused absences at ATDP.
