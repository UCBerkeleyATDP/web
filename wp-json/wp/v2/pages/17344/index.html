Students will need to have a stable internet connection of sufficient speed, a computer capable of joining Zoom meetings, and a camera. ATDP remote classes have a program-wide \u201ccameras on\u201d policy, so students should be prepared for live interactions with instructors and classmates. Course descriptions for online courses contain additional information about that course\u2019s particular remote format, including how much parental involvement may be required.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p id='attendance'>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class='description-block'>\n<div class='course-name'>Attendance <a href=\"#attendance\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n<div class='description-content'>\n<div class='description'>\n<p><em>There are no excused absences at ATDP.<\/em> As expectations are high and courses are fast-paced, even one absence makes it difficult to keep pace.
