You may only request courses for which you have not already been considered. You may also use this form to request to be added to the wait pool for a currently closed class or to request a second course (completing grade 4, 5, or 6).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nGive the Director at least ten business days to review your request and do not send more than one copy of your request.

We will make changes until the second week of June.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIf you are requesting a course change and are planning to decline your current course placement, please act promptly in submitting your <strong>Modify Course Selection<\/strong> form.

If you need to withdraw after you have completed your Enrollment Form, please email your written withdrawal notice to ATDP.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the full refund deadline (June 7th, 2023), payments are refundable. After this date, refunds are subject to the Refund Schedule; see below. No refund will be made in the case of a student who fails to attend classes or is withdrawn from ATDP for failure to meet the standards of appropriate behavior, including completion of homework. Students with outstanding balances after June 29th, 2023 will be automatically withdrawn from the program without refund.\n<\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=2>Refund Schedule<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wednesday, June 7th<\/td>\n<td>100% Refund of tuition paid to date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday, June 23rd<\/td>\n<td>40% Refund of tuition if paid in full<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday, July 7th<\/td>\n<td>20% Refund of tuition if paid in full<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=2>No refund after July 7th<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<ul>\n<li>All withdrawals from the Program must be made in writing (email).<\/li>\n<li>Withdrawal date is the email date.<\/li>\n<li>The refund amounts indicated are based on tuition paid in full.<\/li>\n<li>If paying in installments, refunds are issued only if tuition paid<br \/>\nto date exceeds the refund amount according to the percentages above.<\/li>\n<li>Refunds will be issued by the end of August.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4 id=\"livemeetings\">Live online class meetings<br \/>\n<a href=\"#livemeetings\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h4>\n<p>All students are expected to attend online meetings via the Zoom video-conferencing platform.
