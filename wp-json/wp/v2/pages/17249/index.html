Upon the family&#8217;s request, ATDP will send the final evaluation report and the cumulative record to the school with a recommendation for credit. As ATDP does not recommend credit for grades below a B, the records for such grades are only for the student and cannot be sent to schools. Students and families can create requests in the &#8220;Records&#8221; section of their ATDP account at any time; providing the email address of a school official will send an official digital copy of your records to that address.\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tHigh schools and districts have varying policies about whether students can list ATDP courses on the high school transcript. ATDP can recommend that a student receive credit for grades in the A and B range, but only the student&#8217;s school can actually grant credit. ATDP&#8217;s recommendation is for credit at the high school level, not for college-level credit. However, students taking AP-aligned courses can later earn college credit at participating institutions if they achieve a passing score on the AP exam.\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='columns small-12 medium-5 large-4 hide-for-small-only'>\n\t\t<\/div>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<h3 id=\"to-colleges\">Reporting your course to colleges <a href=\"#to-colleges\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h3>\n<div class='section-block row'>\n<div class='columns small-12 medium-7 large-8'>\n<h5>On college applications<\/h5>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tMany Secondary Division courses are A-G approved and can be reported on the UC or CSU college application, and these courses will count towards meeting the UC\/CSU college entrance requirements.\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tFor other colleges and universities, many applications will include an opportunity to list your ATDP coursework, though details may vary.
