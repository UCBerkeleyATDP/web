Students enrolled in either morning or afternoon ATDP courses will have the opportunity to participate in sports such as basketball, soccer, dodgeball, and baseball, and in fine arts activities such as dance, arts and crafts, and drama. By combining a half-day ATDP class with a half-day of sports camp, participating students will have a full day of activity and balance between academic and recreational enrichment.<\/p>\n<p>Cal Adventures campers will be escorted to or from their ATDP classroom when transitioning between programs, including a supervised lunch hour. Camp is available only on class days, <strong>not<\/strong> on Wednesdays.
