Welcome to UC Berkeley!<\/p>\n<h3>Finding your classroom location<\/h3>\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t have the chance during our Welcome &amp; Orientation day, we encourage you to locate the building in which your class is held well ahead of your first class meeting. Check your <a title=\"My Account\" href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/account\/\">online account<\/a> (requires login) for updated classroom location information. You can search by building name on <a href=\"http:\/\/berkeley.edu\/map\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this online campus map<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Getting around campus on Bear Transit shuttles<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/bear_transit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14890\" \/>Most ATDP class locations are an easily manageable 10-15 walk from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Downtown+Berkeley\/@37.870254,-122.2680518,19.89z\/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857e9dcbbcfba7:0xad74c1e4918cbdb6!8m2!3d37.8701486!4d-122.268106\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Downtown Berkeley BART<\/a> and the ATDP office. However, if your class is held in a more distant location (such as Evans Hall), you can take advantage of the campus shuttle. The Perimeter (&#8220;P&#8221;) Line and Reverse Perimeter (&#8220;R&#8221;) Line offer service to convenient stops all around the main UC Berkeley campus. You can find detailed schedules and other information on UC Berkeley&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/pt.berkeley.edu\/BearTransit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Parking and Transportation website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Your yellow ATDP student ID card is proof of campus affiliation and will allow you to ride the shuttle for free. ID cards are distributed in class on the first day. If you want to ride the shuttle before the first class meeting, the general public fare is $1.<\/p>\n<p>The most convenient stop for students arriving via BART or downtown Berkeley is at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Downtown+Berkeley+BART+Station:+Shattuck+Avenue+@+Addison+Street\/@37.8709919,-122.2677218,19.41z\/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857e9dced911f7:0xe553a3ee7b499caa!8m2!3d37.871038!4d-122.267639\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">southeast corner of Kala Bagai Way and Addison Street<\/a>, outside the Sandwich Zone. Note: <strong>Make sure you are boarding a Perimeter Line or Reverse Perimeter Line shuttle, not a Hill (&#8220;H&#8221;) shuttle.<\/strong> Drivers on other lines may accept your ATDP ID, but these routes lead away from Berkeley&#8217;s main campus.<\/p>\n<h3>Ridehailing Zones<\/h3>\n<p>For those of you who may be using ridehailing services (Uber and Lyft) to come and go from campus, UC Parking and Transportation has established designated pick up and drop off locations for more convenience and efficiency. <a href=\"https:\/\/pt.berkeley.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/tdm_zones_version_2.pdf\">You can use this map<\/a> to see where the established zones are so you can best direct your drivers. <\/p>\n<h3>Parking<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Driving and parking in Berkeley can be very difficult.<\/strong> We strongly recommend using a different mode of transportation whenever possible. If you must drive, see <a href=\"https:\/\/pt.berkeley.edu\/parking\/visitor-parking\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Parking and Transportation&#8217;s Visitor Parking tips<\/a>. Note that most street parking near campus is limited to 2 hours or less, so it is NOT a viable option for older students who are driving their own vehicle.<\/p>\n<h3>Places to hang out before, between, and after classes<\/h3>\n<p>Many students may need a place to wait for parents or to study before or after their class. Others who are taking two ATDP courses may want to know where they can take a lunch break. Luckily, there are many convenient spaces on campus to start on homework or grab a bite to eat.<\/p>\n<h4>Campus Libraries (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lib.berkeley.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/librarymap.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">map<\/a>)<\/h4>\n<p>There are many quiet spots ideal for study in the many campus libraries. The Math\/Statistics Library and the Engineering Library are convenient for students who have classes in Evans Hall. Note that different libraries have different policies regarding admittance of campus visitors; please ask library personnel about their rules first.<\/p>\n<h4>Campus eateries (<a href=\"https:\/\/caldining.berkeley.edu\/locations\/map\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">map<\/a>)<\/h4>\n<p>Cal Dining locations serve both cafe items and grab-and-go food, as well as prepared meals. Cash is accepted, though summer hours may be limited. The closest location to Berkeley Way West is Brown&#8217;s California Cafe, in the Genetics &amp; Plant Biology Building. On Sproul Plaza, the Golden Bear Cafe is just through Sather Gate. The nearest location to Evans Hall is the Free Speech Movement Cafe, part of Moffitt Library at the center of campus.<\/p>\n<h3>Wi-Fi on Campus<\/h3>\n<p>ATDP students and parents have free access to the Berkeley-Visitor network, a wi-fi service intended for visitors to campus. It provides basic Internet access to websites and allows users to use VPN services to connect to their home institutions or enterprises. No password or special configuration is required to access the Berkeley-Visitor network; just check . <a href=\"https:\/\/technology.berkeley.edu\/wi-fi\">Learn more about wi-fi on campus.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On and Around the Berkeley Campus Last updated May 30, 2023 One of the highlights of ATDP&#8217;s Secondary Division is the chance to study, work, and play at the University of California&#8217;s most eminent campus.
