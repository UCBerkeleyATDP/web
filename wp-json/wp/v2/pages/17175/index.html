Aside from creative writing, all of our writing courses share very similar learning goals, just at different levels. We recommend including all acceptable writing course alternatives on your application form. Based on your academic product, grade, age, and Letter of Interest, we will place you in the most appropriate class with other students of similar preparedness.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"filterkey description\" id=\"type-math\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChoosing a Math Course<i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-caret-down\"><\/i><br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/h4>\n<p class=\"description type-math\">Accelerated core math courses are intensive full-year courses that are equivalent to the traditional high school math sequence, and are recommended only for students seeking acceleration at their school.

The petition should explain your summer plan: clearly identify your desired schedule of two courses, making sure their meeting times do not conflict, as well as any alternatives (single courses or other two-course combinations) in order of preference. Also describe how you plan to manage time commitments outside of class meetings. Successful petitions tend to be for two half-year equivalent courses, or one full-year equivalent course with a smaller time commitment and one half-year course.<\/p>\n<p>Please also consider <a href=\"\/programs\/\">Explorations<\/a> if your goal is to plan a full day of activity.
