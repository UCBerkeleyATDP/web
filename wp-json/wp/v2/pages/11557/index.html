Students with special education needs who wish to be considered for accommodations must provide a copy of the psycho-educational report on which their diagnosis is based. This report will be reviewed by the Faculty Director, who will determine which&mdash;if any&mdash;accommodations will be provided at ATDP.

Instead, we suggest that you consider taking a 5-unit math elective for which you have completed the prerequisites or a course in another field of study.<\/p>\n<p class='warning'>For 2023, we will consider requests from students who petition for an exception to this policy.

New Secondary Division applicants are much less likely to successfully petition to take two courses. Certain Elementary Division students completing grade 4-6 may be extended the opportunity to apply for a second course if space allows; this is determined on a case-by-case basis later in the spring. Explorations applicants may apply to as many activities as their schedule reasonably allows.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p id='faq-cat3'>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>Financial Aid<\/h1>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"aidawards\">\n<p class='question'>\nHow are financial aid awards determined?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#aidawards\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>\nFinancial aid awards are based on total family resources, determined in part by tax returns and schedules. We make every effort to help families with limited resources; however, we are often unable to offer full financial aid, and families who receive full financial aid for tuition will still need to pay the course&#8217;s facilities fee. <em>See <a href=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/fa\"> Financial Aid<\/a>.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"limitedaid\">\n<p class='question'>\nI received a larger financial aid award in the past. Why is my aid award smaller this year?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#limitedaid\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>\nATDP&#8217;s financial aid awards are funded through fees paid by attending families and through donations. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our overall budget from 2020 onward, and this in turn affects the amount we can afford to give for financial aid. As always, even families receiving the maximum aid award will be responsible for some amount of tuition. Until our financial situation stabilizes, this amount may vary from year to year.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"financial-change\">\n<p class='question'>\nA drastic change in my financial situation is not reflected on my tax return. What should I do?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#financial-change\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>\nAttach a letter explaining your situation, as well as any supporting documents (e.g., unemployment forms) to the tax forms you send in.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"past-fa-deadline\">\n<p class='question'>\nThe financial aid deadline has passed. Can I still apply for financial aid?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#past-fa-deadline\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>\nEven though our financial aid deadlines have passed, families may request an exception for late consideration. Please note that after the deadlines, our financial aid has already been awarded so our ability to provide aid for new requests is very limited.<\/p>\n<p>To request an exception for financial aid, compose a petition letter addressing the missed deadline and providing a summary of your current financial situation. Please be sure to include any information you would like the program director to be aware of when reviewing your exception request. Include this letter with a complete copy of your most recent tax documents. We strongly recommend that you redact (black out) any sensitive information, such as social security numbers. Please send these documents via fax to 510-642-0510.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p id='faq-cat4'>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>Course Logistics<\/h1>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"class-size\">\n<p class='question'>\nWhat is the average class size?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#class-size\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>Secondary Division classes generally have between 18 and 24 students. Elementary Division classes generally have up to 24 students, with a lead instructor and often an instructional associate and\/or TA. Explorations can vary widely depending on the activity, from small groups to large seminars.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"teachers\">\n<p class='question'>\nWho teaches ATDP classes?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#teachers\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>Our faculty include exceptionally talented public and private school instructors, as well as university researchers and industry professionals.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"tuitionincrease\">\n<p class='question'>\nWhy did your tuition fees increase in 2022?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#tuitionincrease\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>As with many organizations, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted ATDP\u2019s overall budget. At the same time, the cost of business has increased. We are also strongly committed to increasing pay rates for our instructors. ATDP\u2019s course fees were last increased in 2013, so an adjustment was overdue.<\/p>\n<p>It is also important to know that ATDP is self-supporting, funded entirely by paying families. We receive no funding from campus or from external grants.<\/p>\n<p>We do NOT plan to increase costs for those who receive full financial aid awards. Only the tuition fee portion of the course cost has been increased; the program fee\u2014which is paid by all families, even those receiving aid\u2014has not increased.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"formatchange\">\n<p class='question'>\nWhat if it becomes unsafe to hold in-person classes?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#formatchange\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>We are reserving the option to move on-site course offerings to a remote online format at any time and only if deemed necessary by the Program Director.

However, if you can purchase BART Orange tickets from your school, they may be used for transportation to and from ATDP during the summer. <em>See <a href=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/attending\/location\/#bart\">Location & Transportation > BART<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n --><\/p>\n<p id='faq-cat5'>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>Online Learning<\/h1>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"zoom\">\n<p class='question'>\nI&#8217;ve heard Zoom isn&#8217;t secure. Why are you using it for online classes instead of some other platform?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#zoom\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>Zoom is UC Berkeley\u2019s officially supported remote instruction platform. We\u2019ve paid very close attention to reports of security issues with Zoom at other schools (such as \u201cZoom-bombing\u201d), and we promote best security practices. Zoom meetings at UC Berkeley require participants to join with any registered Zoom account. You can sign up for free <a href=\"https:\/\/zoom.us\/freesignup\/\" target=\"_BLANK\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>. (Parents of younger students should create their own account to share with their child under their supervision.)<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"technology\">\n<p class='question'>\nWhat if I don&#8217;t have the minimum technology required for live online class meetings?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#technology\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>If you anticipate having a lack of technology or technical problems, be sure to discuss it in the &#8220;Concerns&#8221; section of your online Enrollment Form. We will work with families on a case-by-case basis to see if any accommodations can be made. Note that there are some courses\u2014such as First-Year Japanese or Public Speaking\u2014where students will absolutely need to actively participate in live, face-to-face meetings over Zoom.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"computer-time\">\n<p class='question'>\nDo I need to be at my computer for the full 3.5 hours of class each day it meets?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#computer-time\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>Your time in front of a screen will vary depending on your instructor\u2019s lesson plans, and each class meeting will involve a mix of live, interactive activities and independent, self-directed work. While students do need to be available for the 3.5 hour window, they will likely not spend the entire time in a Zoom meeting for most classes. We are strongly recommending that teachers limit continuous blocks of screen time, working in a variety of learning activities and breaks. Instructors may also offer more flexible face-to-face meetings such as office hours or small group meetings outside of the scheduled class time.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"activities\">\n<p class='question'>\nHow will in-person class activities translate online?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#activities\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>This is one of the largest areas of focus that ATDP staff and faculty have worked together to address. Our online course offerings are of comparable value to our usual in-person offerings, even while many adaptations may be needed. Where possible, instruction will be consistent with our original in-person course descriptions.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"rigor\">\n<p class='question'>\nWill the online courses be as rigorous?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#rigor\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>While many courses have been revised for the online format\u2014some quite heavily\u2014our expectations remain as high as always. Instructors will offer live interaction and feedback in their areas of expertise, and students are expected to attend every class meeting (see the <a href=\"\/policies#attendance\">attendance policy<\/a>). Remember that every class requires a significant amount of homework and self-study outside of class meetings. As always, ATDP&#8217;s staff, instructors, and academic counselors are ready to collaborate with families to determine the best course of action if a student is struggling.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"lower-fees\">\n<p class='question'>\nWhy aren&#8217;t your online fees lower? An online course is cheaper to run than an in-person course, isn&#8217;t it?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#lower-fees\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>That\u2019s actually a common misconception. When you account for the large amount of curriculum planning and adaptation, online infrastructure, and technical training and testing, running an online course easily matches the cost of running it in-person. ATDP staff and faculty work just as many hours to ensure we maintain the value of our courses and continue to offer instruction of the highest quality.<\/p>\n<p>It is also important to know that ATDP is <em>self-supporting<\/em>, funded entirely by paying families.

Students can achieve grades in the A or B range with a recommendation of high school credit. Students below a B will be assigned a grade of Pass or No Pass, and will not receive a recommendation of credit.<\/p>\n<p>Elementary Division students will receive a narrative report.

Missing too much class time may result in dismissal from the program. Students are expected to attend every class session, and any exceptions must be reviewed by ATDP prior to the refund deadline. Even if you miss only one class, it may not be possible for you to compensate for the work and in-class time missed. In the Secondary Division, absences may make it impossible for ATDP to recommend credit for the completion of the course. <em>See <a href=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/policies\/#attendance\">Attendance Policy<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='faq-block' id=\"switching\">\n<p class='question'>\nIf a course is offered both on-site and online, can I switch between the two?<br \/>\n<a href=\"#switching\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p class='answer'>No. Applicants must choose to apply to an on-site course or an online course.
