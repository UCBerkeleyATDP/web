Students who anticipate any problems in meeting the technology requirements of online class meetings must inform ATDP as soon as possible. (List these in the &#8216;Concerns&#8217; section of your online Enrollment Form.)\n<\/p>\n<p>Technology malfunctions or other difficulties that prevent full participation in class may constitute an absence and are not the responsibility of ATDP.

You may only request courses for which you have not already been considered. You may also use this form to request to be added to the wait pool for a currently closed class or to petition for a second course.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nGive the Director at least ten business days to review your request and do not send more than one copy of your request. We often need to wait for spaces to open up before we can make course changes, so please be patient. We will make changes until the end of May. Check current course availability on <a href=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/programs\/sd\/catalog\">our online catalog<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIf you are requesting a course change and are planning to decline your current course placement, please act promptly in submitting your <strong>Modify Course Selection<\/strong> form. We will send you a new course placement notice if we are able to accommodate your request. You will then have ten business days to accept or decline the new offer.\n<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"withdrawal\">Withdrawals &amp; Refunds<br \/>\n<a href=\"#withdrawal\" class='bookmark'><i class=\"bookmark fa fa-fw fa-link\"><\/i><\/a><\/h4>\n<p>If you decide not to accept your course placement, you must select the appropriate option on the online Enrollment Form (in the Forms tab of your account). The form must be submitted no later than Monday, May 8th, 2023 (Early and Standard window applicants) or within 2 weeks of your course placement offer (Extended window applicants), but please complete it as soon as possible so that another student can be placed in the class. If you need to withdraw after you have completed your Enrollment Form, please email your written withdrawal notice to ATDP.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the full refund deadline (May 17th, 2023), payments are refundable. After this date, refunds are subject to the Refund Schedule; see below. No refund will be made in the case of a student who fails to attend classes or is withdrawn from ATDP for failure to meet the standards of appropriate behavior, including completion of homework. Students with outstanding balances after June 9th, 2023 will be automatically withdrawn from the program without refund.\n<\/p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=2>Refund Schedule<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wednesday, May 17th<\/td>\n<td>100% Refund of tuition paid to date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday, June 2nd<\/td>\n<td>40% Refund of tuition if paid in full<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday, June 16th<\/td>\n<td>20% Refund of tuition if paid in full<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=2>No refund after June 16th<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<ul>\n<li>All withdrawals from the Program must be made in writing (email).<\/li>\n<li>Withdrawal date is the email date.<\/li>\n<li>The refund amounts indicated are based on tuition paid in full.<\/li>\n<li>If paying in installments, refunds are issued only if tuition paid<br \/>\nto date exceeds the refund amount according to the percentages above.<\/li>\n<li>Refunds will be issued by the end of August.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Secondary Division 2023 Guide for Online Students &nbsp; Course Placement Preparing for Class Policies &amp; Procedures &nbsp; Welcome!
