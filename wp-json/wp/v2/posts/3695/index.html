It\u2019s not only updated but also redesigned to make it easier for applicants to find the information they need, whether it\u2019s learning about application and admission or tuition and payment. We\u2019ve added a course index page to help applicants get an overview of all the courses, including which grades they are open to and the days and times classes meet. Also, we hope that our redesigned application instructions and forms make applying easier.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, all <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/applying\">catalog information<\/a> is also now available at our website. To help us save paper and for quicker processing, we encourage everyone to <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/apply\">apply online<\/a> when possible. If former students don&#8217;t need the paper catalog they receive by mail, we ask that they please pass it along to a friend who might want to attend ATDP.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re looking forward to receiving 2012 applications from our many returning students as well as the numerous new students who will be making ATDP a part of their summer for the first time.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"clear: both;\" \/>\n<h1>New Elementary Division Courses<\/h1>\n<p>At ATDP\u2019s Elementary Division, our goal is to offer classes that allow students to gain deep knowledge in a specific subject. We also aim to give students something different from what they already study during the school year. And, very importantly, we strive to have classes that are taught in an engaging way that will give students a passion for the subject studied. To achieve these goals, this year we\u2019re offering three new Elementary Division courses\u2013\u2013Fun with Math, <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/about\/ed\/catalog\/first\/#course-id-7796\">Earth Sciences: Gee!-ology<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/about\/ed\/catalog\/first\/#course-id-7795\">Greek Mythology<\/a>.<br \/>\n[<a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/new-elementary-division-classes\/\">Read more&#8230;<\/a>]<\/p>\n<hr style=\"clear: both;\" \/>\n<h1>New Secondary Division Courses<\/h1>\n<p>Each year, ATDP works to offer courses that will enrich students\u2019 interests and enhance their academic skills.
