Your hard work will be recognized via a Final Evaluation. See below for details.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: When will I receive my final grade?<\/strong><br \/>\nA: Final evaluations, each including a grade and a narrative report, will be mailed to the student\u2019s home address in late August. Note that a student\u2019s evaluation cannot be mailed home or to the student\u2019s school if the student\u2019s tuition is not paid in full.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I request credit for my class?<\/strong><br \/>\nA: We recommend credit for students who have earned grades in the A and B ranges, but only your home school can decide whether and how to report your ATDP class on your transcript.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I report my grade to my school?<\/strong><br \/>\nA: When you receive your final evaluation in the mail, it will come with a yellow postcard. Return that postcard marked \u201cYES\u201d if you\u2019d like us to send an official evaluation to your home school. Make sure to include your school\u2019s name and address!\u00a0If you prefer, the yellow postcard will also give instructions for completing this process online.<br \/>\n<em>IMPORTANT NOTE:<\/em> Be mindful of the deadline on the yellow postcard. In order to process a postcard sent after the deadline, we will require a stamped envelope addressed to your school.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: I\u2019m taking a 10-unit math class, and my school needs to verify my ATDP grade before I can start taking the next math class at school. Will I get my grade in time?<\/strong><br \/>\nA: Although the narrative reports will not be ready until late August, we will send final grades for 10-unit math classes as soon as they are available so that students can finalize their schedules for the Fall. We estimate that these early-release grades will be mailed around August 10. Note that a student\u2019s evaluation cannot be mailed home or to the student\u2019s school if the student\u2019s tuition is not paid in full.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I don\u2019t want my grade sent to my school?<\/strong><br \/>\nA: No problem! We will not forward an evaluation without your authorization. Just return the yellow postcard marked \u201cNO.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I report my ATDP class on a college application?<\/strong><br \/>\nA: Please do not list UC Berkeley as a college you have attended! If your school has granted credit, it will appear on your regular high school transcript. On college applications, you should then list it as coursework completed at your high school. ATDP makes a great addition to your personal statement, and on the UC application, you can include ATDP in \u201cEducational Preparation Programs\u201d (Activities &amp; Awards, Step 2).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Congratulations to those students who are now approaching the final stretch of Secondary Division!
