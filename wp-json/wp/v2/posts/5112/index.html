I\u2019m Jesse Erwin. I\u2019m one of the counselors at ATDP this summer so I thought I\u2019d take a moment to tell you a little about myself. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, spending most of my childhood riding my skateboard around Marin County. Upon graduating from UC Davis with degrees in psychology and education, I moved to Washington, DC where I earned my masters degree in experimental psychology. After enduring several long, unbearably hot summers, I returned home to California.<\/p>\n<p>I am currently entering my fourth year in the school psychology program at UC Berkeley. This is the third year I have worked with ATDP but my relationship with the program goes much further back. As a junior in high school, I was fortunate enough to take Writing for College at ATDP and I have many fond memories of my experience. This year, I have the pleasure working at both Secondary and Elementary Division sites this summer. I always look forward to working with such diverse, motivated, and thoughtful students and this year will be no different. I also look forward to meeting the parents of our students so please don\u2019t hesitate to come by and chat.<\/p>\n<p>You can reach Jesse at <a href=\"mailto:atdpcounselor1@gmail.com\">atdpcounselor1@gmail.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><figure aria-describedby=\"figcaption_\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" ><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/2568_58304021679_6820371_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"142\" \/><figcaption id=\"figcaption_\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Gerchow<\/figcaption><\/figure> Hello everyone! My name is Christine Gerchow and this August I will enter my second year of Berkeley&#8217;s School Psych. Ph.D. program. In addition to being a student at Berkeley I am also a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) for ATDP, a job I absolutely love! During the academic year I also work as an instructor for UCLA where I teach an online course about counseling college-bound students.<\/p>\n<p>Before enrolling at Berkeley I earned my teaching credential and taught in a bilingual first grade classroom. I also taught at the Girls Leadership Institute. Outside of teaching I have worked as a high school counselor in Richmond, CA, and as as after-school program curriculum coordinator in Oakland, CA. My favorite way to spend a day of work is to do everything in my power to make learning and schooling accessible, fun, and rewarding for students. So whether it&#8217;s helping a student through a tough problem, proofreading an essay, talking about friendships, family, college, stress (and pretty much everything else!), I am available to help! My greatest passion is uplifting young people and providing them with the tools and support to succeed. I look forward to working with you this summer!<\/p>\n<p>You can reach Christine at <a href=\"mailto:atdpcounselor2@gmail.com\">atdpcounselor2@gmail.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><figure aria-describedby=\"figcaption_\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" ><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/profilepic.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" \/><figcaption id=\"figcaption_\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crystal Simmons<\/figcaption><\/figure>Hello everyone, my name is Crystal Simmons and I will be working as a counselor of the secondary division during the last 3 weeks of the program. I am a graduate from the UC Berkeley School Psychology Program and worked for the secondary division of ATDP 2 summers ago. I also work as a School Psychologist in a Bay Area school district. The most important thing that I want students and staff to know is that I am here to support you in being successful this summer.<\/p>\n<p>I am here to consult with teachers to help them make the learning experience in their class fun and supportive for all students. I am available to help students with a variety of skills including time management, organization, test taking, and study skills. Knowing that this program can be stressful, I am also available to help students and teachers manage their stress and anxiety.
