My name is Veronica Wong and I\u2019m a rising senior at Piedmont High School. Today I\u2019ll be sharing with you a few thoughts I have about ATDP. But since you\u2019ve already heard so much about how wonderful it is, I\u2019d like to present a different perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATDP sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bet you weren\u2019t expecting that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, teachers and returning students, don\u2019t boo me offstage yet, and parents, please don\u2019t withdraw your student from the program. Like everyone else has and will say, ATDP is a wonderful summer program. But here are two ways in which it is terrible: the classes are hard and getting to know the classmates and teachers is not fun. Just hear me out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, the coursework at ATDP is very difficult. In my first year of Secondary Division, I took the First-Year Latin class. Having aced all my classes in seventh grade, I thought the course would be a breeze. Imagine my surprise after the first test, when, for the first time in my life, I was handed a paper with a big fat C-minus. Not only that, I eventually finished the course with my first ever B. The next year, I was shocked to find the Chemistry class just as demanding. In fact, each of the five ATDP classes I\u2019ve taken was immensely challenging, especially in comparison to the corresponding courses at school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that many of you are straight-A students who find academics easy. You\u2019re the big fish of your school\u2019s little pond, and you\u2019re used to doing well without putting in much effort. I was in the same boat. But with the fast-paced courses and the many hours of homework each day, I found myself struggling to keep up. To be honest, my first two years at ATDP were very hard and, yeah, really sucked. But they forced me to develop new study habits and to manage my time better. Instead of coasting along the surface, I dug deep into the course material and studied it in new ways. I challenged myself and learned so much more than I used to. Not only was I able to keep up with ATDP, I could also apply my new skills to tougher classes once I entered high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust me, ATDP will be challenging and will probably suck if you\u2019re unprepared. But don\u2019t give up! You already got here \u2014 you can do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, ATDP sucks because of the people. Just hear me out. Last year, I took AP Biology, which meets eight hours a day, three times a week for six weeks. My nine classmates and I spent a total of 144 hours together, working on partner labs, emailing each other for homework help, panicking over the final on the group text, getting boba after class at Purple Kow. Never before had I met such a brilliant, diverse group who loved biology as much as I did. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the instructors at ATDP are wonderful. In six weeks, my ATDP chemistry teacher covered material that took five months to teach at regular school. Not only that, he did it clearly and succinctly and even managed to set aside a day to have fun with labs. I loved the class and learned so much from it that I was even given the opportunity to come back the next year and be a teacher\u2019s assistant, which gave me the chance to meet even more incredible students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why does ATDP suck? It\u2019s too short \u2014 only six weeks, which is not nearly enough time to spend with the amazing classmates and teachers. Like I said before, making friends with them is not fun, because you\u2019ll rarely see them again after this summer. You\u2019re going to make friends with a lot of people who have the same interests as you do but may or may not have a similar background and perspective. My advice is to definitely keep in touch with everyone! Don\u2019t lose these valuable and unique connections!<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, no, obviously ATDP does not suck. Personally, it has challenged me, shown me what subjects I\u2019m really interested in, helped me meet intelligent and passionate people, and even given me my first real job. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, the normal school year pales in comparison to these six weeks at ATDP. It has changed my life, and I really hope it will do the same for you too. I wish you a great summer, and thank you!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi everyone, and welcome, new and returning Secondary Division students!
