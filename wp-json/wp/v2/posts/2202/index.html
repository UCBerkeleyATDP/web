One day out of the blue, Henk Admiral, a student in my 10th grade Humanities class took me over to the fiction section in the school&#8217;s outstanding library (I can&#8217;t explain that) and said, &#8220;Miss, you&#8217;re a Yank so I know you love baseball. I just read a beaut book about baseball that I want you to read,&#8221; and he handed me a copy of Chaim Potok&#8217;s <em>The Chosen<\/em>. I quickly gave up trying to convince Henk that the book wasn&#8217;t about baseball, and maybe his copy was, but he and his friends were willing to spend several afternoons with me at the &#8220;tuck shop&#8221; talking about Mr. Malter&#8217;s remarks about how we choose to fill our time. Henk found the book because the librarian gave it to him and told him that he&#8217;d like it. It was not for a class, he didn&#8217;t need to do any outside reading. That experience with literature transformed Henk into a pipe fitter who reads and discusses ideas with pals and taught me the transformative power of literature.<\/span><\/span>As an aside: If you think that baseball is a metaphor for life, or vice versa, take a look at: <em>Shoeless Joe<\/em> (this book was the inspiration for the movie Field of Dreams), W.

Nahin<\/td>\n<td style=\"background-color: ivory;\" valign=\"top\" width=\"540\"><span style=\"color: #2f4f4f;\">This informative and entertaining book is the first comprehensive treatment of the subject, one that is sure to appeal to anyone interested in the mathematics that underlie the all-too-human endeavor of pursuit and evasion. Writing in an accessible style that has been enjoyed by popular-math enthusiasts everywhere, Nahin traces the development of modern pursuit theory from its classical analytical beginnings to the present day. Along the way, he informs his mathematical discussions with fun facts and captivating stories. Nahin invites readers to explore the different approaches to solving various chase-and-escape problems. He draws upon game theory, geometry, linear algebra, target-tracking algorithms&#8211;and much more. Nahin offers an array of challenging puzzles for beginners on up, providing historical background for each problem and explaining how each one can be applied more broadly. <em>Chases and Escapes<\/em> includes solutions to all problems and provides computer programs that readers can use for their own cutting-edge analysis.<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: ivory;\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"240\"><em><strong>Dueling Idiots and Other Probability Puzzlers<\/strong><\/em><br \/>\nby Paul J.
