These should arrive at your home address early next week. The evaluation includes the final grade, recommendation of credit (if any), and instructor&#8217;s narrative. Please note that we cannot release grade and narrative information over the phone.<\/p>\n<p>Evaluations for families with outstanding tuition balances will not be released until the balance is paid in full.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Forwarding the Final Evaluation to Your School<\/h4>\n<p>If your grade is a B- or above and your ATDP instructor recommends that you receive credit, we will send your evaluation to your school upon your instruction. If you do not respond, we will not send your evaluation to your school.<\/p>\n<p><i>Please respond in one of the following ways before <b>Monday, September 9, 2013<\/b>.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>1. Go to your <a title=\"My Account \u2013 2013 Enrollment\" href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/account\/enrollment\/\">2013 Enrollment menu<\/a> (requires login), click on \u201cSend My Eval\u201d and follow the instructions.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b><i>or<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>2. Complete, stamp and return the yellow postcard that was enclosed with your mailed evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>If you miss the deadline to respond or need an additional copy of your evaluation, you may mail a separate written request to ATDP with a stamped envelope addressed to yourself or to your school. Allow five business days for us to mail additional copies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Receiving Credit from Your School<\/h4>\n<p>Remember that ATDP <i>recommends<\/i> credit, but it is your school or district that <i>grants<\/i> credit by listing your ATDP courses on your high school transcript.<\/p>\n<p>Grades of A+, A, A\u2013, B+, B, and B- indicate a level of proficiency sufficient for us to recommend to your school that academic credit be granted for the course completed at ATDP. In the case of sequential courses, these grades also indicate our recommendation as to whether you are academically prepared to proceed to the next course in a sequence (such as proceeding from Algebra I to Geometry). Grades of Pass and No Pass do not carry a program recommendation for credit, and these evaluations cannot be forwarded to the school.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Listing an ATDP Class on Your College Application<\/h4>\n<p>If you are applying to college at a University of California campus, you may include ATDP in <i>Educational Preparation Programs<\/i> (under <i>Activities &amp; Awards<\/i>). You may also discuss your experiences at ATDP in your Personal Statement. Applications for other colleges will provide similar opportunities for you to list special programs and elaborate on your academic history.<\/p>\n<p>List ATDP classes under coursework completed only if your school has granted credit for the course and it appears on your regular high school transcript.<\/p>\n<p><i>NOTE:<\/i> ATDP courses are not considered UC Berkeley classes. Do <strong>not<\/strong> list UC Berkeley as a college previously attended unless you have taken college-level courses offered by the University.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Reapplying and Spreading the Word for Summer 2014<\/h4>\n<p>In early January, we will automatically send you the 2014 ATDP catalog and application form, which will contain the information on how to apply for next year\u2019s summer program. If you would like to participate in our effort to go green, please <a title=\"Community\" href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/community\/\">subscribe to our e-newsletter<\/a>, which is sent 2-3 times per year and contains important program announcements.<\/p>\n<p>We encourage you to apply to ATDP throughout your high school years, through the summer after 11<sup>th<\/sup> grade. In order to return next year, you must maintain a high level of academic performance <i>and<\/i> scholarly conduct as well as submit a complete, well thought-out application by the returning student deadline in mid-February. <i>Readmission is not automatic<\/i>. Your past participation in ATDP will give you an advantage for both admission and course placement, but early applicants are still more likely to be placed in their preferred courses.<\/p>\n<p>If you enjoyed your experience at ATDP, please spread word to fellow students or to your school\u2019s principal, GATE coordinator, or counselor. Encourage them to visit our website or call us this fall if they would like additional information or would like to be placed on our mailing list for next summer&#8217;s catalog and application. By January, the application and course listings for summer 2014 will be posted here on our website.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Contacting the ATDP Office<\/h4>\n<p>If you still have questions about your transition back to school and ATDP course credit, please feel free to call (510) 642-8308 or e-mail atdpoffice@berkeley.edu.
