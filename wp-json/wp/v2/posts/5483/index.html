This Tuesday,\u00a0<em>The Writing Process <\/em>ventured to the Valley Life Sciences Building, which is surrounded by an impressive variety of trees.<\/p>\n<p>After some focused reading in the sunshine, students gathered around Ms. Griffin and accepted their mission: to write a detailed, evocative description of one tree using figurative language and drawing upon the richness of nature. According to Ms. Griffin, this activity was inspired by UC Berkeley professor and former poet laureate Robert Hass, who &#8220;took his writing classes outside to write about the natural environment they saw around them.&#8221; Haas noticed that his students could not name the trees that they saw and even had trouble describing them with any depth. Ms. Griffin remembers that Hass &#8220;said something like, <strong>&#8216;How can we care about something enough to save it, if we don&#8217;t know its name?&#8217;<\/strong>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As students broke into pairs to &#8220;meet a tree,&#8221; Ms. Griffin mused, &#8220;I like to imagine them, years later, coming across this same tree with a connection to it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Environmental Science<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5519\" aria-describedby=\"figcaption_attachment_5519\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" ><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10150998803101880.455274.170703026879&#038;type=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5519\" title=\"IMG_9982\" src=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_9982-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_9982-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_9982-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_5519\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students examine their aquariums for signs of life.

Students learn about biogeochemical cycles, energy flow and conversion, and food webs, all while illustrating the complexity and fragility of our global environment. \u00a0On top of that, it provides a context for students to understand the science behind environmental problems, such as the giant &#8220;dead zone&#8221; in the Gulf of Mexico.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Our young scientists will see signs of life in their bottled worlds astoundingly soon. &#8220;Come back in about a week,&#8221; co-instructor Thomas Ryan advised, &#8220;and you should already be able to be able to see the strength of the ecosystem.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Cognitive Neuroscience<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5512\" aria-describedby=\"figcaption_attachment_5512\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" ><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10150998811716880.455277.170703026879&#038;type=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5512\" title=\"IMG_0331\" src=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0331-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0331-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0331-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_5512\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Instructor Paul Bulakowski prepares to be scanned.
