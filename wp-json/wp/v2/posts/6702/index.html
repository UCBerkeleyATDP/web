My name is Christine Gerchow and I am the ATDP Secondary Division Counselor. This August I will enter my third year of Berkeley&#8217;s School Psych. Ph.D. program. My research interests are in the areas of mental health, adolescent development, and gifted education. In addition to being a student at Berkeley I am also a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) for ATDP, a job I absolutely love! During the academic year I also work as an instructor for UCLA where I teach an online course entitled &#8220;Counseling the College Bound Student.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Before enrolling at Berkeley I earned my teaching credential and taught in a bilingual first grade classroom. I also taught at the Girls Leadership Institute. Outside of teaching I have worked as a high school counselor in Richmond, CA, and as as after-school program curriculum coordinator in Oakland, CA. My favorite way to spend a day of work is to do everything in my power to make learning accessible, fun, and rewarding for students. So whether it&#8217;s helping a student through a tough problem, proofreading an essay, talking about friendships, family, college, stress (and pretty much everything else!), I am available to help!<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s make 2013 the best ATDP summer yet!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"figcaption_\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" ><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"  \" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC00375-Version-22.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"149\" \/><figcaption id=\"figcaption_\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jesse Erwin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Hi there. I\u2019m Jesse Erwin, one of the counselors at ATDP this summer, so I thought I&#8217;d take a moment to tell you a little about myself. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, spending most of my childhood in Marin County. I graduated from UC Davis with degrees in psychology and education, I earned a masters degree in experimental psychology at American University in Washington, D.C. After enduring several long, unbearably hot summers, I returned home to California.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently a doctoral candidate in the School Psychology program at UC Berkeley, and I&#8217;m working hard to get my dissertation done. This is the fourth year I have worked with ATDP but my relationship with the program goes much further back. As a junior in high school, I was fortunate enough to take Writing for College at ATDP and I have many fond memories of my experience. I have the pleasure working at both Secondary and Elementary Division sites this summer. I always look forward to working with such diverse, motivated, and thoughtful students and this year will be no different. I also look forward to meeting the parents of our students so please don\u2019t hesitate to come by and chat.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Although the ATDP office is located in University Hall, your handy dandy counselors will be stationed conveniently in 4320 Tolman Hall, near many of our Secondary Division classes.
