Well, let the School Library Association say it, &#8220;Harriet the Spy was a groundbreaking book: its unflinchingly honest portrayal of childhood problems and emotions changed children&#8217;s literature forever. [It] remains one of the best children&#8217;s novels ever written. The fascinating story is about an intensely curious and intelligent girl, who literally spies on people and writes about them in her secret notebook, trying to make sense of life&#8217;s absurdities. When her classmates find her notebook and read her painfully blunt comments about them, Harriet finds herself a lonely outcast. Fitzhugh&#8217;s writing is astonishingly vivid, real and engaging, and Harriet, by no means a typical, loveable heroine, is one of literature&#8217;s most unforgettable characters.
