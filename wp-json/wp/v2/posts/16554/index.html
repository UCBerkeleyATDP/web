These consist of 15 full year courses across 7 subject areas (labeled with letters A through G), some of which can be fulfilled by completing two half year courses, completing college courses, or earning certain scores on SAT, Advanced Placement (AP), or International Baccalaureate (IB) exams. See the <a href=\"https:\/\/admission.universityofcalifornia.edu\/admission-requirements\/freshman-requirements\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UC admissions website<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.calstate.edu\/apply\/freshman\/getting_into_the_csu\/pages\/admission-requirements.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CSU admissions website<\/a> for details regarding the A-G subject requirements.<\/p>\n<p><h5><em>Who will be able to count ATDP classes toward college entrance requirements?<\/em><\/h5>\n<p>The UC and CSU applications allow students to report classes taken the summer after 9th grade and later.

Each fall, ATDP updates our website with information about how to include ATDP courses on your college applications (and we also make our best effort to contact any current seniors who have taken ATDP classes!).
