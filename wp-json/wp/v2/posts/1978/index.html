The results of Nina\u2019s legacy could not be clearer: everyone in the room spoke the same language of academic development and passion for teaching. They exchanged stories and ideas not only of student learning but \u2013 just as importantly \u2013 what they were learning as educators from their students and, of course, from Nina and the years-long conversation she has grown.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_223\" aria-describedby=\"figcaption_attachment_223\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" ><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/newsletter\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/nina-zach-300x2491.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-223\" title=\"nina-zach-300x249\" src=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/newsletter\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/nina-zach-300x2491.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"249\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zach Rosner (right) and Nina Gabelko at her end-of-summer gathering<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In a recent interview, cognitive neuroscience\u00a0doctoral candidate and AP Psychology instructor Zachary A. Rosner pointed out that, from his many conversations with Nina Gabelko, he understands that the two aspects of ATDP to which she points with greatest pride are:<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 offering an exciting, informative educational experience in a diverse range of classes in which students are highly successful, and<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 ensuring that classes are made available \u2013 even reaching out \u2013 to students regardless of background,\u00a0demographics, or financial situation.<\/p>\n<p>Over twenty years, these two goals have solidified into a steadfast culture at ATDP. As Faculty Director Frank C. Worrell notes: \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Nina\u2019s commitment to excellence and the program\u2019s sense of community that Dr. Adena Young, a former student and teacher in ATDP, is now at the helm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Continuing the Conversation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having been involved with ATDP beginning in 1994\u00a0\u2013 and later, the Graduate School of Education \u2014 Adena Young has been able to rely on the decades of work and wisdom that have accumulated in its offices, archives, and people, while at the same time looking forward to the next round of students filling the classrooms of UC Berkeley and Washington Elementary School.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is an honor to become the interim director of ATDP, a program that has greatly impacted me both as a student and an educator,\u201d said Dr. Young. \u201cI look forward to continuing and furthering ATDP\u2019s mission of providing meaningful and enriching educational experiences to all students who want to learn.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The day-to-day operations of ATDP\u2019s main office and its director\u2019s office continue apace in preparation for the 2012 session: obtaining feedback from its community of instructors, investigating potential new course offerings, and supporting high school seniors as they apply for college, to name a few. Visiting Professor and Head Counselor\u00a0Beverly Vandiver commented on the challenges that face the program, writing: \u201cI believe ATDP will meet them in ways that are innovative and reflective of best practices in developing the academic development for all students. Academic talent development, the philosophy of the program, is a tradition worth keeping and doesn\u2019t require innovation.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As you may already know, Nina Hersch Gabelko \u2013 ATDP\u2019s director for almost a quarter of a century \u2013 retired on October 1st and Adena Young has been named interim director.
