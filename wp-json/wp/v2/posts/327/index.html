I\u2019m a doctoral student at Berkeley. We are looking to recruit high school students for a research study on student\u2019s conceptual learning in science. For this study we are comparing students and experts conceptual understanding about topics in science. Participating in the study requires three interviews during a one-month period in Tolman Hall on the campus of UC Berkeley. The interviews will be scheduled at the students and parents convenience. A small amount of compensation (gift certificate in the range of $5-$10) is available for participating in the study. If the student drops out of the study mid-way through they will still receive the full compensation. During the interviews students will be asked to interact with various physics toys and think about how various phenomena in science work. No formal knowledge about science is required. If you would like more information or if you are interested in joining the study, please contact the lead investigator, Lauren Barth-Cohen at 858-692-4582 or <em>lbarth@berkeley.edu<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi everyone!
