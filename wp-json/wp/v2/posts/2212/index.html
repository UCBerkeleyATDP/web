Be sure to check out Laura Shefler&#8217;s captivating article about her AP Art History class&#8217; exploration of the wonderful world of online art archives and their virtual visit to a mosque halfway around the world. SD instructors Junko Hosoi and Nathaniel Kirk bring us up to date on during-the-year activities of their 2009 students from their First-Year Japanese and Marine Biology classes, respectively. Paul Bruno and his co-instructor Patty Holman enjoyed their ED Human Anatomy and Physiology classes so much that Paul wrote to share some of their and their students&#8217; joys with you.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also Erin Donohue&#8217;s piece on two Elementary Division students who came all the way from Los Angeles to join us this past summer\u2014helped by some incredibly generous mentors. And don&#8217;t forget to check out all our new offerings for summer 2010. It&#8217;s a year of many changes, but the ATDP promise of a challenging, enriching academic experience remains the same.<\/p>\n<h3>Going Greener, Growing Greener, Still<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/atdpweb.soe.berkeley.edu\/bart2tolman\/walk12.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"10\" \/>Deep thanks to the hundreds upon hundreds of ATDP families who have already responded so positively in support of our effort to become greener. It will be a multi-year process because, just like everyone else, ATDP must accomplish as much as we can with our available resources and then gather the additional ones required to do more. Here is where we are for the coming summer:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Our online catalog<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">For 2010, we ask everyone to use the ATDP online catalog.<\/span> Please encourage your family, friends, and others who might be interested in attending ATDP to visit our main website, <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\"><strong>atdp.berkeley.edu<\/strong><\/a>, where they will find both Secondary and Elementary Division catalogs and applications. The Summer 2010 materials will be available by early January 2010.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to apply to ATDP<\/strong><br \/>\nTo help us prepare to go paperless (and save the office staff&#8217;s eyes), fill out your ATDP application on our website! To make sure we get everything right this first time around, we&#8217;ll still ask that you print your completed application after submitting it online and mail it in along with your other application documents (see Application Instructions for a complete list). If you apply this way, you&#8217;ll also be able to pay your application fee by credit card.<\/p>\n<p>A very limited number of paper applications and catalogs will be available in the ATDP office for those who have no internet access at home, at school, or in their local public library.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A new way to pay<\/strong><br \/>\nFor the first time, ATDP is making available online, secure, payment by credit card. Instructions and options will be available as part of the 2010 application.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>What will we be able to do in future years?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As soon as we can, we&#8217;ll be asking those of you applying online (and we hope there are many) to submit your entire applications electronically! For you, this means no photocopying, no stamps, and no trips to the post office. For us, this means less wasted paper, more accurate information, and faster processing! Look for these changes in the next few years. As always, we appreciate your help.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Catching up to the (fiscal) times<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>After 20+ years, we are forced to increase the application processing fee. Beginning Summer 2010, the fee will be $50. Information for financial aid applicants will be found in the application forms, online and in print.<\/p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"bottom\" width=\"260\">Best regards,<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/virtualatdp.berkeley.edu\/newsletter\/fall08\/ninasignature.gif\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www-gse.berkeley.edu\/faculty\/NHGabelko\/NHGabelko.html\">Nina Hersch Gabelko<\/a>, Director<br \/>\n<span>UC Berkeley ATDP<\/span><\/td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"bottom\" width=\"260\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/virtualatdp.berkeley.edu\/newsletter\/fall08\/franksignature.gif\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www-gse.berkeley.edu\/faculty\/FCWorrell\/FCWorrell.html\">Frank C.

While I most certainly agree, to my mind one of the best parts of that diversity is the delicious <em>food<\/em> it makes available! And the only things that I love more than the wealth of different foods are the family stories that food represents. Wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful to compile your stories with accompanying recipes in a cookbook that we could sell to raise funds for financial aid to ATDP students? We&#8217;re seeking your favorite recipes, accompanied by a story\u2014it can be either serious or funny. I&#8217;ll start the ball rolling by offering to tell you the story about the first time I helped to make matzos in displaced persons&#8217; camp in 1947. Or, if you prefer, I can tell you about why it took dozens of tries to get S.J.B.&#8217;s Romanian recipe for stuffed cabbage to come out right\u2014when she shared a recipe, she always left out a key ingredient. Yes, she was just a tad competitive. So take a minute and send your recipes and the stories that go with them to <a href=\"mailto:atdpoffice@berkeley.edu\">atdpoffice@berkeley.edu<\/a> along with a picture or photo and we&#8217;ll publish a cookbook that will permit low income students to come to the ATDP table. ~ Nina<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear ATDP students, parents, alumni, and friends Vignettes from the Summer of &#8217;09 by Teachers Patty, Paul, Nate and Junko-sama From Watts to Berkeley, Part 2 by Erin Donohue AP Art History at ATDP by Laura Shefler A Day in the Life of Washington School&#8230; An ED photo gallery from Summer &#8217;09 Classes jumping for [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<a role=\"link\" class=\"rtp-readmore\" title=\"Read more on Community Newsletter Vol. 2\" href=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/atdp-newsletter-fallwinter-09\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read More \u2192<\/a>","protected":false},"author":345,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[53],"tags":[67],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2212"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/345"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2212"}],"version-history":[{"count":24,"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2212\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3219,"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2212\/revisions\/3219"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2212"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2212"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2212"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
