Your gift will support ATDP&#8217;s ability to serve academically talented students, ones like yours, and to help them to develop their academic talent by choice not chance, regardless of lack of family resources. The need is great, and ATDP aspires to meet it with the help of our extended ATDP family of former students, parents, grandparents, and friends.<\/p>\n<p>It is most gratifying to note that, even after nearly three decades, when our alumni list their most valuable K-12 educational experiences, they speak about the range of ATDP experiences that prepared them academically and socially for the road ahead. The most frequently mentioned experience is their opportunity to learn within a student body with so many interests in common, one composed of individuals from so wide a range of life experiences but all with a common purpose\u2014to learn richly and deeply. Some alumni even reached back two decades or more to single out an ATDP class, teacher or peer who made a lasting difference in who they are and how they think.<\/p>\n<p>Please help us extend the benefits of ATDP to more Bay Area students by making a tax-deductible contribution. Your generous support will help us continue to meet the needs of academically talented students\u2014to make their intellectual development by choice, not just by chance. If there are particular ATDP activities you would like to support, we will dedicate your contribution as you direct us.<\/p>\n<p><em>Gifts in any amount are deeply appreciated!<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">To make a tax-deductible contribution to ATDP,<br \/>\nwrite a check payable to <em><strong><span style=\"color: #00008b;\">&#8220;UC Regents&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><\/em>.
