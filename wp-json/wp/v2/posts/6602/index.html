Once you receive your placement packet in the mail, there are several steps you should take right away in preparation for your summer at ATDP.\n <\/p>\n<h3>1. Return your <em>Notification of Acceptance or Withdrawal<\/em> whether you plan to attend or not.<\/h3>\n<p><strong>If you accept your placement<\/strong>, follow the instructions on your placement notice to remit your tuition check by the tuition deadline. For Secondary Division students, this is April 26. For Elementary Division students, this is May 29.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you do not accept, please respond as soon as possible.<\/strong> We have many applicants on waiting lists for courses that have filled, and we cannot consider placing them until you release your spot. If you have an account on our website, you can simply send us an email using the address tied to your ATDP online account. (All withdrawal notifications must be in writing: email, fax, or post mail; we cannot process withdrawals over the phone.)\n <\/p>\n<h3>2. Submit emergency and permissions information.<\/h3>\n<p>You can easily submit the required information by going to the <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/account\/enrollment\/\" target=\"_blank\">My 2013 Enrollment<\/a> menu and clicking on the \u201cUpdate\u201d button next to the line reading \u201cEmergency &amp; Permissions.\u201d If you are a returning user, you should double-check all your information for accuracy before submitting it. You can always return to this form to provide new information to ATDP in case it changes.\n <\/p>\n<h3>3. Join the carpool list.<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/account\/enrollment\/\" target=\"_blank\">My 2013 Enrollment<\/a> menu also gives you access to ATDP\u2019s automated carpool directory. For each class, click on the \u201cCarpool Info\u201d button to select your transit preferences and opt in to the list. The more families who join, the more useful it is for everyone! If you aren\u2019t finding any matches, try including more areas in your search, or check again later after more families have opted in.\n <\/p>\n<h3>4. Order your 2013 ATDP t-shirts!<\/h3>\n<p>For the first time in over 30 years, ATDP plans to sell program t-shirts to its admitted students and their families. We know how much pride our students have after a rigorous summer; now they can wear it! Ordering information is on the reverse side of your <em>Notification of Acceptance or Withdrawal<\/em> form.\n <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To students admitted to ATDP&#8217;s 2013 summer session: congratulations!
