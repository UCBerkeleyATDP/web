Worrell, we are pleased to announce that we will have a new Program Director starting in January.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Lisa Kala is a long-time supporter of ATDP and has worked with the program as a collaborator, an administrator, and even a parent! Born and raised in San Francisco, Dr. Kala graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology, earned an M.S. in Multicultural Counseling from San Francisco State University, and earned a Ph.D. in Education at UC Berkeley with emphases in minority achievement, minority counseling, and education technology. <\/p>\n<p>For over 30 years, much of her work has been in support of developing the academic talent of diverse students, whether through teaching, research, or outreach. Dr. Kala has held a variety of roles within UC Berkeley&#8217;s Graduate School of Education, most recently serving as Assistant Dean for Administration and Special Projects. She has also served as director of several outreach and research projects for the school, and has teaching and counseling experience at the high school, community college, and university levels.  She looks forward to meeting and getting to know the students, families, and teachers that make up the ATDP community.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Worrell will continue in his role as Faculty Director, and we would like to take this opportunity to thank him for the additional guidance he has provided to the program in the past few years. We are honored and excited to welcome Dr. Kala officially in 2016!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After four years under the tireless stewardship of our Faculty Director, Dr. Frank C.
