It\u2019ll look much like this eNewsletter and will help us all to realize more of the program\u2019s primary goals \u2013 to foster a productive and caring community of students, educators, and researchers, and lovers of learning.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-227\" title=\"revamp-screenshot-300x196\" src=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/newsletter\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/revamp-screenshot-300x1961.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" \/>Last summer, I established a new version of our online academic component: the ATDP Commons. As is the tradition with our virtual class pages, it allowed students to communicate and coordinate with their peers and instructors during the program in a space that was all about the concepts and culture of their ATDP course. Going forward, we\u2019d like to integrate that social technology into our primary website, allowing instructors, parents, and others a forum to share stories, tips, and ideas related to the program year-round. When you log in, you\u2019ll be able to submit an application online, check its status, and make tuition payments.<\/p>\n<p>With this new setup, we\u2019ll continue to pursue lively and informative updates via our newsletter \u2013 look forward to hearing from us a bit more often, but please also consider contributing. In this issue, we\u2019ve got some wonderful <a title=\"How Did They Do That?\" href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/how-did-they-do-that\/\">anecdotes and advice from last summer\u2019s instructors<\/a>. In the future, we\u2019d love to feature student accomplishments, new developments in education, and program announcements.
