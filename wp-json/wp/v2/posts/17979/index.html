The past two years upended our usual timelines, and while we were hoping to return to our usual calendar, continued uncertainties and evolving University policies have required a little more time to plan! We are aiming to have our application process open to the public around mid-January of 2022.<\/p>\n<p>We highly recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/confirmsubscription.com\/h\/r\/C055B349F5F56DD0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subscribing to our community newsletter<\/a> if you haven&#8217;t already! We send very infrequent updates (2 or 3 a year) via email, including for the opening of our applications.<\/p>\n<h3>Faculty positions now open<\/h3>\n<p>ATDP is always on the lookout for amazing teachers to join our summer cohort. We still have a handful of spots to fill for currently planned 2022 courses, and we always welcome new course proposals.
