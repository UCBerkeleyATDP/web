You still need to look at the books to see where and if they fit into your family&#8217;s beliefs and traditions. But even having said that, I need to ask you to consider something else.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Maurice Sendak&#8217;s<\/strong> and <strong>Roald Dahl&#8217;s<\/strong> works are among my very favorite books, even as an adult. Yet, developmentally, I&#8217;m asking you to see where they fit into your sequence of literature choices for your child. They are not to be missed, so I ask that you decide when <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">your<\/span> child should read them.<\/p>\n<p>Sendak, as he intends to do, evokes real fears as children experience them. I would suggest that if you are not reading the books to or along with your child, that you wait a year or so beyond the time that your child is able to read the book on his or her own. The same caution goes for Dahl&#8217;s wonderful books. The tales that Dahl tells tap deeply into moral development and require the reader to consider the exceptions to rules. That is a very advanced developmental reasoning process. The morals of the books are both good and true, but they require a fairly sophisticated level of moral reasoning.<\/p>\n<p>That brings us back to the point where we began this conversation. Please look beyond your child&#8217;s ability to read and define words, even his or her ability to use words effectively in a sentence. Please look toward your child&#8217;s level of development.
