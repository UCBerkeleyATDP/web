Talent development is a deliberate choice, especially as students become older and more independent. Interestingly, time spent studying did not explain the differences in students&#8217; enjoyment or expected grades, which suggests that students&#8217; choices and intentions may be important factors in themselves.<\/p>\n<p>What questions do you have about ATDP students? <a href=\"mailto:atdpoffice@berkeley.edu\">E-mail the ATDP office<\/a> with your questions and suggestions!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What student decision-making\u00a0means for grades, effort level, and enjoyment of the program Have you ever wondered what ATDP does with the end-of-summer surveys?
