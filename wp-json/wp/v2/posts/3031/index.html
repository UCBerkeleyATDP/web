Presently, each develops public transportation policy at regional and national levels. One works for a governmental agency and the other for an international firm, each earning a most respectable income.. Their post-secondary education and career paths are as similar as their pre-collegiate lives were dissimilar, until each came to ATDP.<\/p>\n<p>Paul\u2019s parents, upper middle class professionals, third-generation Bay Area residents, were gladly able to send him to ATDP and to support him in his academic and co-curricular activities. Cesar, the child of recent immigrants and agricultural workers, had neither the advantages of enriched schooling nor educated parents. Neither did Cesar have the benefits of paying for books or activities to further his own academic interests. Yet he did have deep academic interests, which he brought with him to ATDP.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 250px; border: 5px double #C48321; float: right; padding: 12px; margin: 5px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Help provide financial aid for ATDP students by making a tax-deductible donation online:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/givetocal.berkeley.edu\/egiving\/index.cfm?Fund=FU0964000&amp;project=Financial%20Aid%20to%20assist%20low%20income%20families\">Give to ATDP Financial Aid<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">or help ATDP in other areas:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/givetocal.berkeley.edu\/egiving\/index.cfm?Fund=FU0964000&amp;project=ATDP%20Annual%20Fund%20to%20support%20continued%20program%20excellence\">ATDP Annual Fund<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/givetocal.berkeley.edu\/egiving\/index.cfm?Fund=FU0964000&amp;project=Research%20Efforts%20to%20support%20ATDP%27s%20work%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20teaching%20and%20learning%20for%20academically%20talented%20students\">Research Efforts<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You may also donate by writing a check payable to <strong>&#8220;UC Regents&#8221;<\/strong>.

However, Cesar could have done neither without ATDP, and he could not have attended ATDP without the availability of financial aid, made possible by families like Paul\u2019s. Thanks to that aid, Paul and Cesar met at ATDP and became fast friends\u2014and they both have benefitted from the intellectual, professional, and social support they have provided to each other. In fact, we as a society have benefitted greatly from each of their achievements.<\/p>\n<p>ATDP has many, many more such examples to share: some the stories of physicians serving underserved communities, some of attorneys in successful private practices, and most happily, large numbers of teachers who understand the importance of becoming educated with someone exactly like themselves\u2014someone whom circumstance would have prevented them from meeting and growing with, had it not been for the financial aid made available to them at ATDP.<\/p>\n<p>Without your assistance, such possibilities are closed to youth who seek to work hard in order to learn, achieve, and contribute. Please help such students meet others just like themselves, only from very different life circumstances. Please help students develop their potential. Please help students contribute to our society. Please help students grow into positions that will permit them to help themselves and those who now seek to attend ATDP. Please contribute to ATDP\u2019s financial aid fund.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Public mass transportation policy is a career path for two ATDP alumni.
