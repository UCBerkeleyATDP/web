They catch onto ideas quickly and they do not think in terms of the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer. By high school kids have a style of acceptable answer down\u00a0pat; this is good in that it is evidence of an organized thought process, but it also limits their\u00a0perspective. Upper elementary students are still thinking extremely creatively.<\/p>\n<h4>How will this course enhance and build upon what students are learning at school? <\/h4>\n<p>The clearest\u00a0connection is to eighth grade physics and chemistry. After completing this ATDP course students\u00a0will have a firm grasp of the basics of motion and friction. On a broader level this course helps\u00a0students see that science is all around them and that understanding the scientific perspective on\u00a0phenomena is incredibly fun. It is much more difficult to choose to ride a bicycle on a low tire\u00a0after gliding across blacktop on a thin layer of air.\u00a0We are going in-depth on basic\u00a0phenomena; it reminds us why science is such a great subject to study.<\/p>\n<h4>Is there anything else that you&#8217;d like to share about your background or motivations for teaching\u00a0this course? <\/h4>\n<p>Dana and I are a husband and wife team. Together we have over forty years of\u00a0teaching experience. We have worked in regular education classrooms, special education,\u00a0administration, youth-at-risk and with home schooled children. We love kids. We love science.\u00a0And we really love having fun. In our room everyone learns, everyone feels safe and we work very hard to ensure that everyone has fun.<\/p>\n<h4>Just for fun: Which of Newton&#8217;s laws is your favorite to teach? Why? <\/h4>\n<p>I\u2019d go with Newton\u2019s\u00a0Third Law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law is a great excuse\u00a0to push each other around on carts, skateboards, etc. and to shoot off baking soda and vinegar\u00a0powered drag racers. It also has the beauty that once you understand it, evidence of it is\u00a0everywhere. That is the joy of this class; it brings a new perspective to phenomena that you see\u00a0all of the time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The interview below is a part of a series on New ATDP Courses for 2013.
