It\u2019s recounted here because, of course, we wish to publically congratulate Syed Mohsin on his outstanding achievement. For younger students and their parents, this conversation is a wonderful model of the supportive relationships, academic curiosity, dedication, and hard work required for academic success.

Anything for ATDP. And it&#8217;s interesting that you quote Macbeth, because I believe that will be one of the first books I will read at Columbia, and also I&#8217;ve just finished studying Hamlet for my English class. What a great play! Anyways, indeed, I&#8217;m so excited. In fact, in my house I sometimes spontaneously scream &#8220;Columbia!&#8221; and someone in my family will scream &#8220;Columbia!&#8221; back to me from another part of the house. It&#8217;s become a fun game now.<\/p>\n<p>Haha, obscure Greek tragedies&#8211;sounds absolutely amazing! But I am really so lucky and blessed to be able to go to Columbia, and hopefully it&#8217;ll be everything I&#8217;ve ever hoped for and more. Thanks for being so happy for me!
