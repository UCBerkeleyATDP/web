Since it lacks energy, blue drags itself across the ground to get from one place to another and leaves a trail of its translucent goo behind. Beneath a light, blue sparkles and shines but can only be noticed from the corner of your eye. The light shining right through the core of blue makes a beautiful, yet abnormal sight to see.<\/p>\n<p>From ten feet away, blue\u2019s horrid odor of burnt rubber, stings the nose. As it slowly makes its way through the streets and neighborhoods, it does not mind the traveling rumors it hears or the events occurring beside it. Even though blue is lonely, it is very independent.<\/p>\n<p>Blue loves to dance and sing. You often can hear it echoing a bird\u2019s song or a haunting and high-pitched child\u2019s lullaby. Blue often scrunches up in a silent corner and sings to itself through the night.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Annalise Sawit<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Blue is the feel of smooth, soft velvet<br \/>\nThat has just been washed.<\/p>\n<p>Blue smells like the salty, crisp air<br \/>\nOn a beach at sunrise.<\/p>\n<p>Blue tastes like a mouthful of ice cubes<br \/>\nOn a hot summer day.<\/p>\n<p>Blue sounds like the ring of shots coming from the rain drops on a tin shed.<\/p>\n<p>Blue feels like a cold gust of wind on a fall afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Blue feels like a wisp of a polar bear hide.<\/p>\n<p>Blue smells like moist paint on canvas.<\/p>\n<p>Blue tastes like dry-wall in a newly renovated office building.<\/p>\n<p>Blue smells like rain-damped wool that has been sitting in the sun.<\/p>\n<p>Blue sounds like the hum of a washing machine.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Melissa Van Pell<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the smell of the shore as you walk down the boardwalk<br \/>\nAnd the sweet taste of melting popsicles in the blinding Sun, which can\u2019t stop<\/p>\n<div align=\"right\">shining<\/div>\n<p>Blue brings a comforting sense to everyone around it<br \/>\nBut also has the power to cause people to break out into the blues<br \/>\nSlipping on the icy road or a full-speed snow ball crashing in your face<br \/>\nThe tune of a low sax singing its tune next to calm waters brings my mind straight to<\/p>\n<div align=\"right\">blue<\/div>\n<p>It boasts constantly about a better tomorrow.<br \/>\nAlways doing a sweet dance until the sun goes down<br \/>\nNo forks for blue as it devours its meal with its bare hands<br \/>\nIn its shining Ferrari glistening in the Sun, making a blur as it races down the road<br \/>\nSkipping down the road in a baggy old tee and torn up jeans.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Diogo Villas-Boas<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Blue is what you feel when you\u2019re<br \/>\nDown, it smells like a pig\u2019s den<br \/>\nIt relishes eating the eye<br \/>\nOf a chicken while it\u2019s still<br \/>\nAlive.
