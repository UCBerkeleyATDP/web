Nina has taught at Oakland Technical High School (Government, Sociology, and US History), St. John\u2019s School in El Cerrito (fifth grade), and an Australian non-academic secondary school, as well as at middle and high schools in Huntington Park and San Leandro.<\/p>\n<p>Through her teaching experiences Nina developed interests in students\u2019 stereotyped thinking and prejudice.\u00a0 She began asking questions based on what she saw in her schools: What is prejudice?\u00a0 How is prejudice communicated?\u00a0 How is prejudice learned?\u00a0 In 1977, these questions led Nina back to UC Berkeley\u2019s Graduate School of Education, where she studied prejudice and stereotype thinking.\u00a0 Within a year, Nina completed her Master\u2019s Degree in Curriculum and Instruction with a focus on Social Studies and Cognitive Sophistication while concurrently co-authoring a book entitled\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Reducing-Adolescent-Prejudice-Hersch-Gabelko\/dp\/080772601X\" target=\"_blank\">Reducing Adolescent Prejudice<\/a>.\u00a0 Not surprisingly, after this year, Nina still had more questions to pursue, so she continued her studies in education at UC Berkeley, resulting in an Ed.D. in History and Anthropology of Education.\u00a0 In her doctoral dissertation, Nina used historical and anthropological points of view to study how students from different minorities groups experienced school.<\/p>\n<p>After completing her doctorate, Nina continued to work in the Graduate School of Education first as a researcher in the School\u2019s Evaluation Unit and then in 1985 becoming Director for the School-University Partnership for Educational Renewal (SUPER), a partnership with the Graduate School of Education and 20 nearby schools in two districts. \u00a0(Her association with Carrie Brown, assistant director of ATDP dates back that far, as it does with Lloyd Nebres, who retired from ATDP in 2010, and Nancy Mellor, who still heads Coalinga-Huron-Avenal House, ATDP\u2019s only residential component.) Through SUPER, participating teachers, school and district administrators, and UC professors collaborated toward reaching mutually established goals for education reform.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ATDP Through Nina\u2019s Eyes<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_235\" aria-describedby=\"figcaption_attachment_235\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" ><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/newsletter\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/nina1987-209x3001.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-235\" title=\"nina1987-209x300\" src=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/newsletter\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/nina1987-209x3001.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"209\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_235\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nina Gabelko circa 1987<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>While still directing SUPER in 1987, Nina assumed the directorship of ATDP, with Carrie Brown also wearing two hats, and Lloyd Nebres already in place. \u00a0At the time, ATDP was called the \u201cUC Berkeley Gifted Program\u201d and served students who were conventionally identified as \u201cgifted\u201d based on their SAT scores. As the new Program Director, Nina worked with developmentalists and other faculty, classroom teachers, community members, parents, and graduate students to predicate a program on the understanding that academic talent is not innate, but rather that it is developed over time through students\u2019 experiences.\u00a0 Today, ATDP continues to serve students based on this philosophy that academic talent should not be mined but instead should be grown\u2014that children grow, with rich educational experiences, mentors, and many peers from novices to experts.

She takes great delight to the contributions of groups and individuals who helped make these improvements possible and who continue to work for excellence, of which equity is an important part. She recalls with pleasure ATDP\u2019s long\u201415+ year\u2014association of the SFUSD Department of Integration, including Ms. Bess Ricketts, Dr. Tony Anderson, Ms. Bettye Saunders, and Dr. Ritu Khana and Ms. Jan Link, who continue the good fight. Of course, Frank Worrell\u2019s association with ATDP began at his very arrival at Berkeley as a doctoral student and continues through his responsibilities as director of the School Psychology Program and Faculty Director of ATDP. Penn State professor Beverly J. Vandiver has been extending and implementing ATDP\u2019s goals for going on 15 years as the program\u2019s head counselor and as a researcher. Adena Young\u2019s participation in ATDP began during her years as a student, teaching assistant, instructor, math department chair, post doctoral researcher, and presently as ATDP\u2019s interim director.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_201\" aria-describedby=\"figcaption_attachment_201\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" ><a

ATDP, it\u2019s all about the passion of learning.<\/p>\n<p>Nina\u2019s passion for diversity extends to the range of learning experiences present in ATDP classes.\u00a0 At the Elementary Division, Nina describes the Kindergarteners and First Graders as children who take on the roles of scientists and often fall in love with learning.\u00a0 They discover that there is wonder in learning and that there are endless questions to ask.\u00a0 At the Secondary Division, students in enrichment classes encounter unique opportunities to get a flavor for topics and learning experiences that they cannot get anywhere else.\u00a0 Through these enrichment courses, such as Anthropology and Sociology, students learn that there is a purpose to learning, and that their thinking and knowledge can be relevant to their lives.\u00a0 In accelerated courses such as Advanced Placement Biology, ATDP students and instructors create a collaborative learning community in which they all work together to solve big problem and master huge chunks of knowledge.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_202\" aria-describedby=\"figcaption_attachment_202\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" ><a

Nina has been essential in creating a community of learning between students, teachers, families, graduate students and researchers.\u00a0 At ATDP, people come together to connect around their passions for history, mathematics, science, writing, and languages, and everyone is supported in their learning experiences.\u00a0 Students receive ample academic support through rich conversations with their peers and instructors, as well as through study labs and tutoring opportunities.\u00a0 Teachers receive professional and social support during pre-service trainings, professional development meetings, and consultation.\u00a0 Parents participate in workshops and consultation to learn about how their children learn.\u00a0 Researchers share their knowledge and expertise on learning and talent development with ATDP teachers and families.\u00a0 As a result, ATDP has become a community for anyone who wants to share their knowledge and learn from others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Messages from Nina<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that she\u2019s days into her retirement, Nina \u00a0gives us four important messages.\u00a0 First, education is a passionate pursuit.\u00a0 It is important for students to study things that they care about and to be passionate learners.\u00a0 Second, learning is purposeful.\u00a0 At ATDP, students and teachers make their classes relevant to themselves and the world around them, and they understand that learning is important and meaningful.\u00a0 Third, ATDP is a place to make friends.\u00a0 Students at ATDP meet others with similar interests, and in making connections to those who are like themselves, they feel \u201cat home.\u201d\u00a0 Finally, learning is fun.\u00a0 As Nina says, everyone should leave ATDP smiling, if not giggling.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, Nina, for your passion, knowledge, questions, and commitment to the field of education and more importantly to the wonderful community that ATDP has become.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the Director of the Academic Talent Development Program for the past 24 years, Nina Hersch Gabelko has created meaningful and lasting
