Although this section may be new, ATDP has had a long tradition of involvement in research, in keeping with its role as a division of the premier public research institution in the US and arguably the world. As Dr. Gabelko notes in her introduction to the program brochures, in addition to helping students think and understand more deeply, ATDP is also actively involved in learning more about academically talented students and the factors that facilitate their development.<\/p>\n<p>~ Frank C.

Books were still relatively scarce and expensive, and the routine electronic diversions we take for granted were, of course, nonexistent. If you had grown up listening to adults reading to each other regularly, the thought of all of those solitary 21st-century individuals hearkening to earbuds and car radios would seem isolating. It would also seem as though they were being trained only to listen to books and not to read aloud from them.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And then, when, on top of that, Nicholas D. Kristof, on July 4, 2009, added his own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/07\/05\/opinion\/05kristof.html\">&#8220;Best Kids&#8217; Books Ever,&#8221;<\/a> I knew that I must ask you to visit <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/ninas-reading-recommendations\/\">ATDP&#8217;s reading article<\/a> in our Fall 2008 e-newsletter.

These questions are most useful in saving time for applicants as well as for the people at the receiving end of the questions. But think about it for a moment. Questions become &#8220;frequently asked&#8221; because people know to ask them. If they didn&#8217;t know, they couldn&#8217;t ask. So, what about those questions that people didn&#8217;t know to ask, were too shy to ask, or maybe hadn&#8217;t ever thought about? Couldn&#8217;t some of those be even more useful than many of the frequently asked questions? For this issue, we asked instructors to ask and answer some questions that they would like to be asked more often. <span>[<a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/not-frequently-enough-asked-questions\/\">Continue reading&#8230;<\/a>]<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/atdp-newsletter-summer-09-giving-to-atdp\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/virtualatdp.berkeley.edu\/newsletter\/summer09\/nadiaandlaurie.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/atdp-newsletter-summer-09-giving-to-atdp\/\"><strong>GIVING TO ATDP<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>What happens to young students from schools with a 70% drop-out rate who have the opportunity to attend ATDP?<\/em><span><br \/>\n[ <a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/atdp-newsletter-summer-09-giving-to-atdp\/\">Continue reading&#8230;<\/a> ]<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">FEATURE ARTICLES<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>ATDP alumni working to make the world a better place&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li type=\"circle\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/atdp-and-the-internet-2\/\">&#8220;ATDP and the Internet: Four alumni\u2014Four thousand stories&#8221;<\/a><\/em><\/li>\n<li type=\"circle\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/from-berkeley-to-watts-and-back-again\/\">&#8220;From Berkeley to Watts, and Back Again&#8221;<\/a><\/em><\/li>\n<li type=\"circle\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/worlds-oldest-living-alum-testifies-on-behalf-of-evolution\/\">&#8220;World&#8217;s Oldest Living Alum Testifies on Behalf of Evolution&#8221;<\/a><\/em><\/li>\n<li type=\"circle\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/welcome-home-aimee-lopez\/\">&#8220;Alumna, Engineer, Math Tutor&#8221;<\/a><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"350\" \/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">TIDBITS<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li type=\"circle\"><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/tidbits-from-summer-09\/#1\">ATDP at the GSE Commencement<\/a><\/li>\n<li type=\"circle\"><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/tidbits-from-summer-09\/#2\">DATA: demographic, linguistic, etc.<\/a><\/li>\n<li type=\"circle\"><a href=\"http:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/tidbits-from-summer-09\/#3\">Invitation to apply for scholarships<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the ATDP Family E-Newsletter Dear ATDP students, parents, alumni, and friends, Welcome to our Summer 2009 e-newsletter.
