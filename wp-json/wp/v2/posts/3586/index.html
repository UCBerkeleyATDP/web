Just as I was starting to wonder \u201cWhere in the World is Amy Abdallah?,\u201d I heard from her. It turns out that the question I should have been asking is, \u201cCan you tell me how to get to Sesame Street, Abuja, Nigeria?\u201d That\u2019s where she is and where she\u2019s having the time of her life.<\/em> <em>Amy asked me to reconnect her with everyone and included an update, along with a few photos.

Here, I have my dream assignment. I work on Sesame Workshop. My job description focuses on developing and editing programming and educational materials around literacy, numeracy, HIV awareness, and health and hygiene for teachers, caregivers, and orphaned and vulnerable children throughout all of Nigeria. The programming and materials are part of Sesame Square&#8211;Nigeria&#8217;s version of Sesame Street. (FYI: Sesame Workshop, in addition to Sesame Street, sponsors local versions of Sesame Street, in addition to educational materials, around the world!)<\/p>\n<p>It was earlier this year, around when some thought that I had fallen off of the radar, that I learned I was selected to participate in the IFESH (International Foundation for Education and Self Help) program. IFESH is a non-governmental organization [a 501(c)(3)] that works to improve the lives of people in sub-Saharan Africa by addressing the problems of poverty and illiteracy. IFESH partners with other non-governmental organizations in order to best meet local needs. Their main collaboration is with USAID (United States Agency for International Development), and in my case, also with the Sesame Workshop.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to performing worthwhile, important work, that utilizes parts of my brain that I did not even know exist, I am having a wonderful time in places far away from home with warm, kind, and accepting people. I invite you to <a href=\"http:\/\/adventuresinthebiga.blogspot.com\">stay in touch with me via my blog<\/a>. In the meantime, I\u2019m so glad to have shown you a different side of Sesame Street\u2014Sesame Square&#8211;and have hopefully enticed some to join us.<\/p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"figcaption_\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" ><a href=\"http:\/\/adventuresinthebiga.blogspot.com\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"   \" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-029lItwMohU\/TsP4c9z7pEI\/AAAAAAAAACI\/tpiSi8oxOV8\/s1600\/IMG00022-20111101-1032.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"576\" height=\"430\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"figcaption_\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Well, yes, I do get some getting used to.
