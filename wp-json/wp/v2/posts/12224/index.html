Most are in high school or entering college, and many are concurrently enrolled as students in ATDP courses.<\/p>\n<p>TAs assist course instructors on academic tasks such as scoring quizzes and tests, lab prep work, and individual and\/or small-group tutoring. TAs may also be asked to take attendance, do photocopying, relay messages (by cell phone, e-mail or in person) to the ATDP office, and the like.<\/p>\n<h4>Why TA?<\/h4>\n<p>A teaching assistantship at ATDP is an opportunity to work closely with one of our expert instructors and to act as a role model for other students. The TA program is a great way to strengthen one\u2019s academic network, deepen content knowledge, and gain professional experience. It makes a wonderful addition to any student\u2019s college application or resum\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>As volunteers, TAs are eligible to receive community service credit for their work at ATDP, and this credit can be applied to the <a href=\"https:\/\/atdp.berkeley.edu\/presidents-volunteer-service-award\/\">President&#8217;s Volunteer Service Award<\/a>. Returning TAs may choose to earn a small stipend instead.<\/p>\n<h4>How are TAs selected?<\/h4>\n<p>Prospective TAs complete an application form which asks about their academic knowledge, teaching experience, and skills. <\/p>\n<div class='panel'><strong>Interested students and alumni may apply using <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/forms\/87JUf2bSTp\"><strong>this online form<\/strong><\/a>.<\/strong><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Teachers\u2019 assistants in the Secondary Division are advanced returning students who demonstrate strong community involvement and academic leadership.
