        <p>Dear ATDP community,</p>

        <p>It’s time to celebrate 40 years of the Academic Talent Development Program (ATDP)! In our roles as Faculty Director and the newest Program Director, it is our honor to introduce this commemorative brochure that spotlights ATDP’s rich history and provides a glimpse into our current projects and future plans.</p>

        <p>We hope you enjoy perusing the enclosed timeline, which is organized by four themes that represent the core mission and values of the work we do (see below).</p>

        <h2>A remarkable anniversary</h2>

        <p>It is timely to celebrate 40 years on the heels of what was arguably the most difficult year the program has endured. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the spring, usually a time of fast-paced activity and finalizing plans, instead became a time of uncertainty and unsettling quiet. Urgency followed as we had to cancel our on-site program, plan an online program, and proceed with enrollment, placement, teacher professional development, student orientation, and finally, offering courses—all in eight weeks.</p>

        <p>The hard work paid off, as more than 1400 students participated in remote ATDP courses last summer and summer evaluations indicated an overwhelmingly positive experience.</p>

        <h2>Academic talent development by choice, not chance</h2>

        <p>Forty years ago, ATDP was founded as the UC Berkeley Gifted Program, one of the Talent Search centers intended to improve the education of intellectually gifted students, in keeping with the vision of Julian Stanley, who had recently opened the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. As a public university, UC Berkeley’s mission is broader and the program moved from a talent search model to a talent development model, as reflected in the current name. Now, talent development is one of the major frameworks in gifted education with the development of potential into talent as central to these programs as the identification of talent.</p>

        <p>There are still many hurdles facing gifted education and talent development programs. Students with the potential for outstanding performance are still not included in the concept of a “free and appropriate public education.” There are limited federal resources devoted to gifted education, and funding for these types of programs is dependent on state appropriations, leaving programs like ATDP to pick up the slack for the lack of programming in public schools. And gifted and talented education programs still do not reflect the demographic diversity of the country, as students of color and students from low-income backgrounds continue to be underrepresented.</p>

        <p>As ATDP looks forward to another 40 years, it is our fondest hope that the talent development model becomes more common in gifted education and in public education. In 1998, Lauren Sosniak wrote, “Part of our work as educators is to understand how to create conditions that allow ever larger portions of our youth to work toward the development of talent irrespective of where and to whom they were born.” Programs like ATDP can only serve a fraction of the students with potential, but all of us, as citizens, can insist that academic talent development should be available to ALL students.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being a part of our journey. Here’s to ATDP at 40!</p>

        <p class="r6">As part of the Graduate School of Education at a tier one research university, the ATDP learning environment has provided countless opportunities for gifted education research. We will continue to offer students and families the chance to participate in growing this body of knowledge.</p>

<h3 class="community r5">Finding<br>Community</h3>
        <p class="r6">ATDP courses aren’t just about the curriculum. Every summer, students come from far and wide to share their interests with one another, work in class together, and make new friends. We will support, encourage, and explore ways to connect ATDP students, faculty, and staff.</p>
