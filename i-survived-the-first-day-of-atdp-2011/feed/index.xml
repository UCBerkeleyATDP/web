					<description><![CDATA[Dev, I wanted to thank you for a great class. My son Josef really learned a lot and enjoyed it tremendously - he is hooked. I wanted to ask you though if you could send me an email - I have some comments regarding how the unstructured time at the end of class was used. Thank you, Susi Stadler]]></description>
