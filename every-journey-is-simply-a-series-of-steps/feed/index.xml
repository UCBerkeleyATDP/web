					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I need help,
I got a letter and it tells me to:
1) go to /commons/
2)register for an ATDP Commons acount
3) search your class group
4)request membership

I did #1-3 and I can&#039;t figure out #4.
There&#039;s no button or anything it just says to request membership and no instructions. I&#039;ve looked everywhere!

Please help thanks!
PS
My class is 3133: The Internet Classroom]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, oh, I feel blessed to have previous hands send a blessing to this little experiment.  I guess the cat&#039;s out of the bag with that Facebook post, and there&#039;s no going back now.

Regarding our database: the new 4D is ... the new 4D.  We skipped a few versions and all of GSE is running off of the new v12 (see www.4d.com).  I don&#039;t think there are any specific integration solutions, but there&#039;s nothing to stop us from tying the standard web forms we use now with this WP install.  After this summer, that&#039;s just what I intend to do!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay I have to ask: how did you replace the old 4D?? And can you link the new incarnation up with WordPress??? (Not idle curiosity--labouring under Blackboard at the moment!)

Thanks!

					<description><![CDATA[p.s.: and yeah, my &quot;website&quot; these days is my Twitter account... my online life has pretty much migrated there. I find using Twitter—and inscribing the moments of my days there—an apt representation of life as a whole. Fleeting, shareable in fragments, but the whole in time&#039;s due course revealing a mosaic through which hopefully a pattern appears, some meaning gleanable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is pretty awesome, Sam... and exciting! I look forward to continuing to interact with ATDP (and my former life ::chuckle::) via its Commons. And by the way, it has always been thus with TIC/TVA... using bleeding-edge software and web developments on-the-fly and just-in-time! You are certainly carrying on tradition here. :-)

And somehow I&#039;m not surprised that you&#039;ve ended up with WP (and not Drupal or Joomla or some other CMS). I&#039;ve always liked WP, and I believe we even had an early instance of it installed in one of the servers years ago.

Best wishes for a splendid ATDP summer coming up.

aloha,
L.]]></description>

I guess since we&#039;re officially open for business, sure. Go ahead and link away!

Edit: What weird capitalization? And did you know you can edit comments? ... or is that just me because I&#039;m the admin? XD]]></description>
