					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/featured-courses-2014/#comment-879&quot;&gt;Irene Huang&lt;/a&gt;.

You can apply for both, but you would only be admitted to one or the other.

If you&#039;ve attended the Elementary Division in the past, you are eligible to apply for a small number of Secondary Division courses as a returning 6th grader. Fill out a Secondary Division application. You can include Elementary Division 6th-grade course selections on that same application, if desired.

See the bottom of the page at /about/ed/catalog/sixth/ for more.]]></description>
